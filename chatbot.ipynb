Because of the \\ndevelopment of a large national database \\non normative blood pressure (BP) levels \\nthroughout childhood, the ability to identify \\nchildren who have abnormally elevated BP \\nhas improved. On the basis of developing \\nevidence, it is now apparent that primary \\nhypertension is detectable in the young and \\noccurs commonly. The long-term health risks \\nfor hypertensive children and adolescents can \\nbe substantial; therefore, it is important that \\nclinical measures be taken to reduce these \\nrisks and optimize health outcomes. \\nThe purpose of this report is to update clini-\\ncians on the latest scientific evidence \\nregarding BP in children and to provide rec-\\nommendations for diagnosis, evaluation, and \\ntreatment of hypertension based on available \\nevidence and consensus expert opinion of the \\nWorking Group when evidence was lacking. \\nThis publication is the fourth report from the \\nNational High Blood Pressure Education \\nProgram (NHBPEP) Working Group on \\nChildren and Adolescents and updates the \\nprevious 1996 publication, Update on the \\nTask Force Report (1987) on High Blood \\nPressure in Children and Adolescents.1 \\nThis report includes the following information: \\n■ New data, from the 1999–2000 National \\nHealth and Nutrition Examination Survey \\n(NHANES), have been added to the child-\\nhood BP database, and the BP data have \\nbeen reexamined. The revised BP tables \\nnow include the 50th, 90th, 95th, and \\n99th percentiles by sex, age, and height. \\n■ Hypertension in children and adolescents \\ncontinues to be defined as systolic BP (SBP) \\nand/or diastolic BP (DBP) that is, on \\nrepeated measurement, at or above the 95th \\npercentile. BP between the 90th and 95th \\npercentile in childhood had been designated \\n“high normal.”  To be consistent with the \\nSeventh Report of the Joint National \\nCommittee on the Prevention, Detection, \\nEvaluation, and Treatment of High Blood \\nPressure (JNC 7), this level of BP will now \\nbe termed “prehypertensive” and is an indi-\\ncation for lifestyle modifications.2 \\n■ The evidence of early target-organ damage \\nin children and adolescents with hyperten-\\nsion is evaluated, and the rationale for early \\nidentification and treatment is provided. \\n■ Based on recent studies, revised recommen-\\ndations for use of antihypertensive drug \\ntherapy are provided. \\n■ Treatment recommendations include \\nupdated evaluation of nonpharmacologic \\ntherapies to reduce additional cardiovas-\\ncular risk factors. \\n■ Information is included on the identification \\nof hypertensive children who need addi-\\ntional evaluation for sleep disorders.'),\n",

Thereafter, \\nthe NHLBI Director directed the NHLBI staff \\nto examine issues that might warrant a new \\nreport on children. Several prominent clini-\\ncians and scholars were asked to develop \\nbackground manuscripts on selected issues \\nrelated to hypertension in children and ado-\\nlescents. Their manuscripts synthesized the \\navailable scientific evidence. During the \\nspring and summer of 2002, NHLBI staff and \\nthe chair of the 1996 NHBPEP Working \\nGroup report on hypertension in children and \\nadolescents reviewed the scientific issues \\naddressed in the background manuscripts as \\nwell as contemporary policy issues. Sub-\\nsequently, the staff noted that a critical mass \\nof new information had been identified, thus \\nwarranting the appointment of a panel to \\nupdate the earlier NHBPEP Working Group \\nReport. The NHLBI Director appointed the \\nauthors of the background papers and other \\nnational experts to serve on the new panel. \\nThe chair and NHLBI staff developed a \\nreport outline and timeline to complete the \\nwork in 5 months. \\nThe background papers served as focal points \\nfor review of the scientific evidence at the first \\nmeeting. The members of the Working Group \\nwere assembled into teams, and each team \\nprepared specific sections of the report. In \\ndeveloping the focus of each section, the \\nWorking Group was asked to consider the \\npeer-reviewed scientific literature published in \\nEnglish since 1997. The scientific evidence \\nwas classified by the system used in the \\nJNC 7.2 The chair assembled the sections \\nsubmitted by each team into the first draft of \\nthe report. The draft report was distributed \\nto the Working Group for review and com-\\nment. These comments were assembled and \\nused to create the second draft. A subsequent \\nonsite meeting of the Working Group was \\nconducted to discuss further revisions and the \\ndevelopment of the third draft document. \\nAmended sections were reviewed, critiqued, \\nand incorporated into the third draft. After \\nediting by the chair for internal consistency, \\nthe fourth draft was created. The Working \\nGroup reviewed this draft, and conference \\ncalls were conducted to resolve any remaining \\nissues that were identified. When the Working \\nGroup approved the final document, it was \\ndistributed to the Coordinating Committee \\nfor review. \\n3'),\n",

Not all \\ncommercially available cuffs are manufac-\\ntured with this ratio. Additionally, cuffs \\nlabeled for certain age populations (e.g., \\ninfant cuffs, child cuffs) are constructed with \\nwidely disparate dimensions. \\nAccordingly, the \\nWorking Group recommends that standard \\ncuff dimensions for children be adopted.

The 50th percentile has been \\nadded to the tables to provide the clinician \\nwith the BP level at the midpoint of the \\nnormal range.

The child’s \\nmeasured SBP and DBP are compared with \\nthe numbers provided in the table (boys or \\ngirls) according to the child’\\ns age and height \\npercentile.

However, primary (essential) \\nhypertension is now identifiable in children \\nand adolescents. Primary hypertension in \\nchildhood is usually characterized by mild \\nor Stage 1 hypertension and is often associ-\\nated with a positive family history of \\nhypertension or cardiovascular disease (CVD). \\nChildren and adolescents with primary hyper-\\ntension are frequently overweight. Data on \\nhealthy adolescents obtained in school health-\\nscreening programs demonstrate that the \\nprevalence of hypertension increases progres-\\nsively with increasing body mass index (BMI), \\nand hypertension is detectable in approxi-\\nmately 30 percent of overweight children \\n(BMI >95th percentile).26 The strong associa-\\ntion of high BP with obesity and the marked \\nincrease in the prevalence of childhood obe-\\nsity27 indicate that both hypertension and \\nprehypertension are becoming a significant \\nhealth issue in the young. Overweight children \\nfrequently have some degree of insulin resist-\\nance—a prediabetic condition. Overweight \\nand high BP are also components of the \\ninsulin-resistance syndrome or metabolic syn-\\ndrome, a condition of multiple metabolic risk \\nfactors for CVD as well as for type 2 \\ndiabetes.28,29 The clustering of other CVD \\nrisk factors that are included in the insulin-\\nresistance syndrome (high triglycerides, low \\nhigh-density lipoprotein cholesterol [HDL-C], \\ntruncal obesity, hyperinsulinemia) is signifi-\\ncantly greater among children with high BP \\nthan in children with normal BP.30 Recent \\nreports from studies that examined childhood \\ndata estimate that the insulin-resistance syn-\\ndrome is present in 30 percent of overweight \\nchildren with BMI greater than the 95th \\npercentile.31 Historically, hypertension in \\nchildhood was considered a simple inde-\\npendent risk factor for CVD, but its link to \\nthe other risk factors in the insulin-resistance \\nsyndrome indicates that a broader approach \\nis more appropriate in affected children. \\nPrimary hypertension often clusters with other \\nrisk factors.31,32 Therefore, the medical his-\\ntory, physical examination, and laboratory \\nevaluation of hypertensive children and ado-\\nlescents should include a comprehensive \\nassessment for additional cardiovascular risk. \\nThese risk factors, in addition to high BP and \\noverweight, include low plasma HDL-C, \\nelevated plasma triglyceride, and abnormal \\nglucose tolerance. Fasting plasma insulin \\nconcentration is generally elevated, but an ele-\\nvated insulin concentration may be reflective \\nonly of obesity and is not diagnostic of the \\ninsulin-resistance syndrome. To identify other \\ncardiovascular risk factors, a fasting lipid \\npanel and fasting glucose level should be \\nobtained in children who are overweight and \\n■ Primary hypertension is identifiable in children and adolescents. \\n■ Both hypertension and prehypertension have become a significant health issue \\nin the young due to the strong association of high BP with overweight and the \\nmarked increase in the prevalence of overweight children. \\n■ The evaluation of hypertensive children should include assessment for additional \\nrisk factors. \\n■ Due to an association of sleep apnea with overweight and high BP, a sleep history \\nshould be obtained.'),\n",

Each \\nof these domains has an age-appropriate \\ntrigger question and includes responses of \\nboth parent and child, as appropriate. This \\nbrief screening for sleep history can be com-\\npleted in about 5 minutes. \\nIn a child with primary hypertension, the pres-\\nence of any comorbidity that is associated with \\nhypertension carries the potential to increase \\nthe risk for CVD and can have an adverse \\neffect on health outcome. Consideration of \\nthese associated risk factors and appropriate \\nevaluation in those children in whom the \\nhypertension is verified are important in plan-\\nning and implementing therapies that reduce \\nthe comorbidity risk as well as control BP. \\n17 Primary Hypertension and Evaluation for Comorbidities'),\n",

Several methods for \\nindexing left ventricular mass have been \\nreported, but it is recommended that height \\n(m2.7) be used to index left ventricular mass, \\nas described by de Simone et al.73 This \\nmethod accounts for close to the equivalent of \\nthe effect of lean body mass and excludes the \\neffect of obesity and BP elevation on left ven-\\ntricular mass. Some echo laboratories use \\nheight as the indexing variable. This calcula-\\ntion is also acceptable and is somewhat easier \\nto use, as fewer calculations are needed. \\nChildren and adolescents with established \\nhypertension should have an echocardiogram \\nto determine if LVH is present.

Most hypertensive patients will \\nneed to remain on medications for the rest of \\ntheir lives. Usually, adults readily accept this \\nfact, given the known long-term adverse con-\\nsequences of untreated or undertreated \\nhypertension.117 In children, however, the \\nlong-term consequences of untreated hyperten-\\nsion are unknown. Additionally, no data are \\navailable on the long-term effects of antihyper-\\ntensive drugs on growth and development. \\nTherefore, a definite indication for initiating \\npharmacologic therapy should be ascertained \\nbefore a drug is prescribed. \\nTable 6 summarizes the indications for use of \\nantihypertensive drugs in children. These \\nindications include symptomatic hypertension, \\nsecondary hypertension, established hyperten-\\nsive target-organ damage, and failure of \\nnonpharmacologic measures. Other indica-\\ntions for use of antihypertensive drugs can be \\nconsidered, depending on the clinical situa-\\ntion. For example, because the presence of \\nmultiple cardiovascular risk factors (elevated \\nBP, dyslipidemia, tobacco use, etc.) increases \\ncardiovascular risk in an exponential rather \\nthan additive fashion,118,119 antihypertensive \\ntherapy could be considered if the child or \\nadolescent is known to have dyslipidemia. \\nThe number of antihypertensive drugs has \\nincreased since the publication of the Report \\nof the Task Force on Blood Pressure Control \\nin Children.120 The number of drugs that \\nhave been studied systematically in children \\nhas also increased, largely because of incen-\\ntives provided to the pharmaceutical industry \\nunder the auspices of the 1997 Food and \\nDrug Administration Modernization Act \\n(FDAMA) and the 2002 Best Pharmaceuticals \\nfor Children Act (BPCA).121–123 These devel-\\nopments have had both negative and positive \\nconsequences. Chief among the negative con-\\nsequences is the lack of reliable pediatric data \\nfor older, commonly used compounds with \\nexpired patent protection. Currently, no \\nincentives exist for industry-sponsored trials \\nof such drugs, and alternative methods of \\nstimulating pediatric studies, such as those \\ncontained in the BPCA,123–125 have yet to \\ncome to fruition. On the other hand, publica-\\ntion of the results of industry-sponsored \\nclinical trials and single-center case series will \\n■ Indications for antihypertensive drug therapy in children include secondary \\nhypertension and insufficient response to lifestyle modifications. \\n■ Recent clinical trials have expanded the number of drugs that have pediatric dosing \\ninformation. Dosing recommendations for many of the newer drugs are provided. \\n■ Pharmacologic therapy, when indicated, should be initiated with a single drug. \\nAcceptable drug classes for use in children include ACE inhibitors, angiotensin-\\nreceptor blockers, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, and diuretics. \\n■ The goal for antihypertensive treatment in children should be reduction of BP \\nto <95th percentile, unless concurrent conditions are present. In that case, \\nBP should be lowered to <90th percentile. \\n■ Severe, symptomatic hypertension should be treated with intravenous \\nantihypertensive drugs.'),\n",

It should be noted that many other drugs \\nare available in addition to those listed in table \\n9. Those drugs are not included in the table, \\nhowever, because few or no pediatric data were \\navailable at the time this report was prepared. \\nLong-term, clinical endpoint data from ran-\\ndomized trials, such as the Antihypertensive \\nand Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent \\nHeart Attack Trial (ALLHAT), support the \\npreferential use of specific antihypertensive \\ndrugs in adults.2,126 However, pediatric clin-\\nical trials of antihypertensive drugs have \\nfocused only on their ability to lower BP and \\nhave not compared the effects of these drugs \\non clinical endpoints. Therefore, because all \\nclasses of antihypertensive drugs have been \\nshown to lower BP in children, the choice of \\ndrug for initial antihypertensive therapy \\nresides in the preference of the responsible \\nphysician. Some diuretics and beta-adrenergic \\nblockers, which were recommended as initial \\ntherapy in the first and second Task Force \\nReports,25,120 have a long history of safety \\nand efficacy based on clinical experience in \\nhypertensive children, and these drugs remain \\nappropriate for pediatric use. Similarly, some \\nmembers of the newer classes of antihyperten-\\nsive drugs, including ACE inhibitors, calcium \\nchannel blockers, and angiotensin-receptor \\nblockers,127–130 have been studied in children \\nand, based on short-term use, shown to be \\nsafe and well-tolerated with satisfactory BP \\nreductions in hypertensive children. \\nSpecific classes of antihypertensive drugs \\nshould be used preferentially in certain hyper-\\ntensive children with specific underlying or \\nconcurrent medical conditions. Examples \\ninclude the use of ACE inhibitors or \\nangiotensin-receptor blockers in children with \\ndiabetes and microalbuminuria or proteinuric \\nrenal diseases, and the use of beta-adrenergic \\nblockers or calcium channel blockers in hyper-\\ntensive children with migraine headaches. \\nThis approach is similar to that outlined in \\nthe recent JNC 7 report, which recommends \\nspecific classes of antihypertensive drugs for \\nuse in adults in certain high-risk categories.2 \\nAll antihypertensive drugs should be pre-\\nscribed in a similar fashion:  The child is \\ninitially started on the lowest recommended \\ndose listed in table 9. The dose can be \\nincreased until the desired BP goal is achieved. \\nOnce the highest recommended dose is \\nreached, or if the child experiences side effects \\nfrom the drug, a second drug from a different \\nclass should be added. Consideration should \\nbe given to combining drugs with comple-\\nmentary mechanisms of action, such as an \\nACE inhibitor with a diuretic, or a vasodilator \\nwith a diuretic or beta-adrenergic blocker. \\nBecause little pediatric experience is available \\nin using fixed-dose combination products, \\nexcept for bisoprolol/HCTZ,131 routine use of \\nthese products in children cannot be recom-\\nmended at this time. \\nFor children with uncomplicated primary \\nhypertension and no hypertensive target-\\norgan damage, the goal BP should be less \\nthan the 95th percentile for sex, age, and \\nheight, whereas for children with chronic \\nrenal disease, diabetes, or hypertensive target-\\norgan damage, the goal BP should be less \\nthan the 90th percentile for sex, age, and \\nheight. Again, this approach is similar to the \\nrecommended treatment of hypertension in \\nadults with additional cardiovascular risk \\nfactors or comorbid conditions.2 \\nImportant adjunctive aspects to the drug \\ntherapy of childhood hypertension include \\nongoing monitoring of target-organ damage as \\nwell as BP monitoring, surveillance for drug \\nside effects, periodic monitoring of electrolytes \\nin children treated with ACE inhibitors or \\ndiuretics, counseling regarding other cardio-\\nvascular risk factors, and continued emphasis \\non nonpharmacologic measures. It may also \\nbe appropriate to consider “step-down” \\ntherapy in selected patients. This approach \\nattempts a gradual reduction in the drug after \\nan extended course of good BP control, with \\n27 Pharmacologic Therapy of Childhood Hypertension'),\n",

Computation of Blood Pressure Percentiles for Arbitrary Sex, Age, and Height \\n1. Refer to the most recent CDC growth charts, which are available online, and convert the \\nheight of h inches to a height Z-score relative to boys of the same age; this is denoted by Zht. \\n2. Compute the expected SBP (µ) for boys of age y years and height h inches given by \\nµ= α + Σ β j (y-10) \\nj\\n+ Σ γ k (Zht)\\nk \\nwhere α, β1…, β4 and γ1…, γ4 are given in the 3rd column of appendix table B–1. \\n3. Then convert the boy’s observed SBP to a Z-score (Zbp) given by \\nZbp = (x – µ)/σ \\nwhere σ is given in the 3rd column of appendix table B–1. \\n4. To convert the bp Z-score to a percentile (P), compute P = Φ (Zbp) x 100% \\nwhere Φ (Z) = area under a standard normal distribution to the left of Z. \\nThus, if Zbp = 1.28, then Φ (Zbp) = .90 and the bp percentile = .90 x 100% = 90%. \\n5. To compute percentiles for SBP for girls, diastolic blood pressure (DBP) (K5) for boys, \\nand DBP (K5) for girls, use the regression coefficients from the 4th, 5th, and 6th columns \\nof appendix table B–1. \\nFor example, a 12-year-old boy, with height at the 90th percentile for his age-sex group, \\nhas a height Z-score = 1.28, and his expected SBP (µ) is \\nµ = 102.19768 + 1.82416 (2) + 0.12776 (22) + 0.00249 (23) –0.00135 (24) + 2.73157 \\n(1.28) –0.19618 (1.28)2 –0.04659 (1.28)3 + 0.00947 (1.28)4 = 109.46 mmHg. \\nSuppose his actual SBP is 120 mmHg (x); his SBP Z-score is then: \\nSBP Z-score = (x – µ)/σ = (120–109.46)/10.7128 = 0.984 \\nThe corresponding SBP percentile = Φ (0.984) x 100% = 83.7th percentile. \\n■ To compute the systolic blood pressure (SBP) percentile of a boy who is age y years \\nand height h inches with SBP = x mmHg: \\n4 \\nj=1 \\n4 \\nk=1 \\nComputation of Blood Pressure \\nPercentiles for Arbitrary Sex, Age, \\nand Height'),\n",

      "Query: What are the causes of high blood pressure?\n",
      "Answer: <think>\n",
      "Okay, so I need to figure out what causes high blood pressure (hypertension) based on the provided context. Let me start by reading through the information given carefully.\n",
      "\n",
      "The context is from two reports related to hypertension in children and adolescents. The first part talks about target-organ abnormalities and the risks associated with hypertension in adults, but focuses more on children and adolescents. It mentions that severe hypertension can lead to serious complications like hypertensive encephalopathy, seizures, and cerebrovascular accidents.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the second report section, it discusses evaluating secondary hypertension in children. Secondary hypertension refers to cases where the elevated blood pressure is due to an underlying condition rather than a direct cause.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking for causes of hypertension, I remember that primary hypertension doesn't have a known cause. However, secondary hypertension can be caused by various factors. From the context, it says evaluations should consider possible underlying disorders in every child with elevated BP but particularly when they are very young, have Stage 2 hypertension, or show signs suggesting systemic conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "So potential causes for secondary hypertension might include chronic kidney disease (as mentioned later), obesity, diabetes, infections like HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis, endocrine disorders such as pituitary issues, chronic respiratory diseases, sleep apnea, and certain medications. The context doesn't list primary causes explicitly but implies that in some cases, it's not known.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, does the context mention primary hypertension at all? It seems to focus more on secondary causes because the first report talks about the risk factors for cardiovascular events due to chronic kidney disease, which is linked to hypertension. So perhaps primary hypertension doesn't have a clear cause mentioned here.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, the possible causes are mostly secondary ones like those listed: chronic kidney disease, obesity, diabetes, etc.\n",
      "</think>\n",
      "\n",
      "High blood pressure (hypertension) can be caused either by primary or secondary factors. Primary hypertension typically does not have a known cause and is often idiopathic. Secondary hypertension arises from an underlying condition. Common causes of secondary hypertension include:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Chronic Kidney Disease**: Often linked to high BP due to renin release.\n",
      "2. **Obesity**: Excess body fat can contribute significantly.\n",
      "3. **Diabetes Mellitus**: A metabolic disorder that may cause or exacerbate high BP.\n",
      "4. **Infections**: Such as HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis, which can lead to hypertension.\n",
      "5. **Endocrine Disorders**: Including pituitary issues like cushing's syndrome.\n",
      "6. **Chronic Respiratory Disease**: Conditions like asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).\n",
      "7. **Sleep Apnea**: A sleep disorder that can increase BP.\n",

      "Query: What is the relationship between blood pressure and heart disease?\n",
      "Answer: <think>\n",
      "Okay, I'm trying to figure out the relationship between blood pressure and heart disease based on the provided context. Let me go through each point step by step.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, looking at references 51-56, they all discuss studies linking blood pressure (BP) to heart disease. Reference 51 mentions prospective observational studies showing prolonged differences in BP corrected for regression dilution bias, linking high BP to coronary heart disease and stroke. That's a strong association between high BP and heart issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "Reference 52 talks about severe hypertension in childhood and its potential impact on health, though it doesn't specify the outcomes beyond that it's linked. So, this supports the idea that high BP is related but might not be as clear in children.\n",
      "\n",
      "References 53-56 focus more on specific aspects like left ventricular abnormalities or atherosclerotic changes. For instance, reference 56 mentions that elevated BP is associated with atherosclerotic lesions in the aorta and冠心动脉 (coronary arteries). This indicates that high BP isn't just linked to heart disease but also directly affects the aorta and coronary arteries, which are crucial for heart function.\n",
      "\n",
      "The helpful answer provided earlier states that high BP increases the risk of heart disease. The context supports this by mentioning studies showing that higher BP levels cause damage to target organs like the heart, brain, and eyes. It also talks about non-invasive methods confirming these relationships, suggesting a clear link established through research.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, references 54-56 don't directly answer but support the idea of BP's impact on heart health by discussing related conditions like renal disease and its effects, which indirectly relate to overall cardiovascular health.\n",
      "\n",
      "Putting this all together, the relationship between blood pressure and heart disease is that high BP increases the risk. Studies have shown that higher BP levels lead to damage or dysfunction in the heart and other organs, hence an increased likelihood of heart disease.\n",
      "</think>\n",
      "\n",
      "The relationship between blood pressure (BP) and heart disease is established through multiple studies indicating that elevated BP significantly increases the risk of heart disease. Higher BP leads to structural and functional damage in target organs such as the heart, brain, and eyes. Non-invasive methods confirm these associations, demonstrating a clear link between high BP levels and cardiovascular health risks. Therefore, higher BP is associated with an increased likelihood of heart disease due to organ damage or dysfunction.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Answer:** High blood pressure significantly increases the risk of heart disease by causing structural and functional damage to target organs like the heart.\n",
